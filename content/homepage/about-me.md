I am a T'karonto-based writer of fiction, creative nonfiction, flash, and lyric essay published in Canadian and U.S. journals. My work includes a draft novel, "Sea Change", a collection of vignettes, "Just Put on Some Lipstick", and a memoir about scoliosis, "Caution: Cuves Ahead", in progress. Stories have been central to my life as an educator, editor, CNIB narrator, "Quill & Quire" book reviewer, mum, and nana. In open mic sessions, I enjoy sharing tales of adventure travel, family, and agical connections. A graduate of The Writers Studio, Simon Fraser University, I am an MFA candidate at the Univeristy of King's College, Halifax.
