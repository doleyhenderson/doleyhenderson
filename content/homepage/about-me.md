I am a T'karonto-based writer of fiction, creative nonfiction, flash, and lyric essay published in Canadian and U.S. journals. My work includes a draft novel, a collection of vignettes, and a creative nonfiction book about scoliosis, which is in progress. As a former teacher, editor, CNIB narrator, and "Quill & Quire" book reviewer, I write with wit, grit, and brevity. In open mic sessions, I enjoy sharing my stories about adventure travel on five continents. A graduate of the Writers Studio at Simon Fraser University, I am an MFA candidate at the Univeristy of King's College in Halifax.
