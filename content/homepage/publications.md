### Water World
[In the Vale anthology, July 2022](https://readquebec.ca/book/in-the-vale/)

"I have been one with water since that first sinking and white-atone sparkling....I sway from the gunwhale of the kayak, my legs sliding through the slipstream, and I fist-pump the waves as they wash over me."

### The Scenic Route
[Juxtaprose Literary Magazine, Volume 27, February 2022](https://www.juxtaprosemagazine.org/volume-27/)

“'Zygoma,' we sing out, as Dad points to his cheekbone, during our Anatomy lesson. It is the 1950’s. He is a surgeon and we are his clever girls. We memorize the names of muscles and bones."

### Stryker
[emerge 21: The Writers Studio Anthology, October 2021](https://www.amazon.ca/emerge-21-Writers-Studio-Anthology/dp/1772870838)

"My hospital room is directly behind the nurses' station, so they can skip over when I press the call button. They squeak in to flip Stryker every four hours."

### Human Touch
[The New Quarterly, Issue 158, Spring 2021](https://tnq.ca/issues/issue-158/)

"We ride: he drives, I passenge with helmet and Gore Tex gear.
We love: Hug on the Fox Glacier, kiss on the Zambezi.
We celebrate: Prosecco in the Alps, Pisco sour in the Andes."
