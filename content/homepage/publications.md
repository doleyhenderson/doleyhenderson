### Water World

"I sway from the gunwale of the kayak, my legs sliding through the slipstream, and I fist-pump the waves as they wash over me."

### Sryker

"My hospital room is directly behind the nurses' station, so they can skip over when I press the call button. They squeak in to flip Stryker every four hours."

### Human Touch
[The New Quarterly, Issue 158, Spring 2021](https://tnq.ca/issues/issue-158/)

"We ride: he drives, I passenge with helmet and Gore Tex gear.
We love: Hug on the Fox Glacier, kiss on the Zambezi.
We celebrate: Prosecco in the Alps, Pisco sour in the Andes."
