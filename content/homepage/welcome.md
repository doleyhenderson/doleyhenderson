As a T'karonto-based writer of fiction and creative nonfiction, I share stories about resilience, travel adventures, quirky happenings, and magical connections. Looking through stained-glass windows I compose at my standing desk. World music inspries me, Writing fills me with joy, and family keeps me dancing on and off the page.
