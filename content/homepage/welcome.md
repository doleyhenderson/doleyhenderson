Hi there. A T'karonto-based writer of fiction and creative nonfiction, I share stories about resilience, travel adventures, quirky happenings, and magical connections. As I compose, I look through stained-glass windows at my standing desk, swaying to world music. Writing fills me with joy and family keeps me dancing on and off the page.
